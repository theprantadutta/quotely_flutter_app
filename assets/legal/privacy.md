# Privacy Policy for Quotely

**Last Updated: June 10, 2025**

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the Quotely app.

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Quotely is designed with your privacy in mind. We **do not** have user accounts, and therefore **we do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII)** such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.

### 2. Information We Collect (Analytics)

To improve the user experience and understand how our app is used, we collect anonymous, non-personal analytics data. This data may include:
- App crash reports.
- App performance data (e.g., launch time).
- User engagement events (e.g., which features are most popular).

This information is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.

### 3. Third-Party Services

**Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** We use Firebase, a third-party service from Google, to deliver push notifications to your device. To do this, an anonymous token is generated for your device instance. We do not link this token to any personal information. Firebase's use of data is governed by Google's Privacy Policy.

### 4. Data Storage

Any data you generate within the app, such as your list of favorite quotes or facts, is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app.
